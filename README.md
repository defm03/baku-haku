***********************************************************************************

The roguelike is a sub-genre of role-playing video games, characterized by level
randomization, permanent death, and turn-based movement. Most roguelikes feature
ASCII graphics, with newer games increasingly offering tile-based graphics.Games
are typically dungeon crawls, with many monsters, items, and environmental
features. Computer roguelikes usually employ the majority of the keyboard to
facilitate interaction with items and the environment. The name of the genre comes
from the 1980 game Rogue.
